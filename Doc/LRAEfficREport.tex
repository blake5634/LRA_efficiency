\section*{Introduction}
This is a basic study of energy flows in a resonant system.  A typical application could be a Linear Resonant Actuator (LRA), inside a cellphone case,
held in the fingers.  The objective is to transfer vibration energy into the fingers to create haptic sensations.   Among the questions we will
attempt to answer are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  What is a useful dynamical model and simulation for such a system? What are some reasonable parameter values?
    \item  What are flows of energy which can be quantified in such a system?
%     \item  Only damping elements can dissipate energy. Springs and Masses can only store and return energy.   In the steady state (after starting
%     transients), the total energy stored in all masses (kinetic energy) and springs (potential energy), will therefore be constant.  Therefore, we
%     can ask, what is the dissipation of energy in the two dampers (friction loss elements) $B_1$ the LRA damping, and $B_3$ the damping of the skin
%     model.
    \item A significant practical issue is to ensure the accuracy of our energy computations with respect to numerical errors which may
    occur in simulation algorithms, particularly related to energy balance and conservation of energy.    All energy into the system must
    be properly accounted for as either dissipation in damping elements or residual energy in the storage components (Mass, Springs) at the end of the simulation.
    \item  What is a suitable experiment to simulate with such a computational model
    to study efficiency of
    actuation for vibrotactile haptics?.
     Once the above questions are answered, we can ask the main questions:

         ``Is an an electromagnetic
     actuator with vibration output more efficient if it is a resonant system?''

     and, relatedly,

     ``If it is resonant, is it more energy efficient when driven at its resonant frequency?''
\end{enumerate}

%%%%** Section 1 
\section{Q1: What is a useful dynamical model and simulation for such a system? What are some reasonable parameter values?}

We introduce the model of Figure \ref{3MassSchematic}.
Three masses represent in turn,
$M_1$, the mass of the moving LRA component,
$M_2$, the mass of other components of a hand held device including battery
and case
(my Pixel 6a phone
has a total weight of about 250 grams).
We assume the case and components of the device ($M_2$)
consists of   a rigid body.
$K_2, M_3, B_3$ represent a simplified model of skin at frequencies of about 150 Hz which is
near the most sensitive frequency of human skin and is widely used in haptic signals.

Using standard techniques for dynamical system analysis, we derived   equations
of motion   which accept as input a time varying force
applied to the LRA mass ($M_1$) and the case ($M_2$) in equal and opposite directions
(See the Appendix).   Any force or motion within the system can be an considered
an output which we can
analyze as a result of the applied force.  We can also compute energy flows between
the components of this system.

%%%%** Section 1.1
\subsection{Model Parameter Values}
LRA properties can be directly measured by dissection of LRA devices.  Mass is simplest to obtain by weighing, spring constants can be measured by
compression testing, and damping can be measured by dynamic tests.
Resonance behavior of real devices can be conveniently tested by observing
a voltage transient on its actuator coil when the device is tapped on a table.   With one measured parameter, the others can be inferred from the
frequency ($\omega_n$) and decay time (damping) of the tapping transient.

The biomechanics of skin are complex but here we rely on a previously published study which surveyed skin models in the literature to
derive consensus model parameters for a single point of contact for vibrotactile haptic signal response of skin\footnote{Lindsay, Jack, Richard J. Adams, and Blake Hannaford. ``Improving tactile feedback with an impedance adapter.'' In 2013 World Haptics Conference (WHC), pp. 713-718. IEEE, 2013.
}.
\paragraph{Masses:}
Mass of the LRA moving weight is taken from a typical device characterized in the (Lindsay et al., 2013) reference.   Mass of the case was
obtained by weighing a typical cell phone (Pixel 6a).   Mass of the skin used the same reference but was multiplied by 4 based on the assumption of
4 fingers contacting the phone body simultaneously via 4 skin patches.

\paragraph{Springs:}
LRA constant $K_1$ is derived from the LRA moving mass and the desired resonant frequency
which we held constant at 150 Hz.  Skin spring constant
$K_2$ is also  taken from the reference.

\paragraph{Dampers:}
LRA Damping $B_1$ was derived from $K_1$ by assuming a damping ratio, $\zeta$:
a free parameter setting the degree of resonant behavior expected from the LRA.
For $\zeta=1$, there is no resonant behavior, and as $\zeta$ approaches zero, the system is more and more resonant.  We used a value of $\zeta=0.01$
to represent a typical LRA value of damping.  Parameter values used are given
in Table \ref{ParamTable}.

%%%%** Section 1.2
\subsection{Model Simulation}

The dynamical model of the Appendix was converted to state space (Matrix) form and simulated with a python program using the {\tt python.control} package
(Listings \ref{Listing1} and \ref{Listing2} below).
Input force signals were modeled by a sinusoid function.
To implement this drive in a real LRA, a sinusoidal current would be applied to the
actuator coil or coils.  Rectangular current pulses of any frequency or amplitude can also be simulated.




%%%%** Section 2 
\section{Q2: What are flows of energy which can be quantified in such a system?}
\label{WhatAreEnergyFlows}

When a mass $M$ is driven by a force $f(t)$ it moves according to Newtonian mechanics.  The amount it moves depends on the values of various
parameters such as Masses, Springs, etc.
When a force is applied over a time interval $T$, the energy (Joules)
delivered to the load (or absorbed from the load) is
\[
E = \int_0^T f(t)x(t)dt
\]
Thus we can compute energy flows at any connection in the system where
force and displacement are known.  In our discrete time computational model,
we have
\[
E = \sum_i f(t_i)\Delta x_i
\]
Energy flows of particular interest include total energy flowing out of the force generator represented by $f(t)$, and
total energy dissipation (conversion of energy to heat) taking place in the damper elements.
We consider several energy flows below:

%%%%** Section 2.1
\subsection{Actuator Output}   develops between case and LRA mass. Thus
    it is applied by the actuator at two points and in two directions
    (coil mass is lumped into Case mass) and there are two components:
    \[
    E_{so} = E_1 + E_2 = \sum_i \left[ -f(t) \Delta x_1 + f(t)\Delta x_2 \right]
    \]
    where $x_1, x_2$ are defined in Figure \ref{3MassSchematic} and
    \[
    \Delta x_i = \dot{x}_i\Delta t
    \]
    (We have written this expression in discrete time and simplified out the $i$
    subscripts to allow easy computation with
    simulation output data every $\Delta t$ seconds.)


%%%%** Section 2.2
\subsection{LRA Damping Loss}
    energy converted to heat in $B_1$ is
    \[
    f_{B1} = (\dot{x}_2-\dot{x_1})B_1
    \]
    \[
    \Delta x_{B1} = (\dot{x}_2-\dot{x}_1)\Delta t
    \]
    giving
    \[
    E_{B1} = \sum_t B_1(\dot{x}_2-\dot{x}_1)^2\Delta t
    \]

%%%%** Section 2.3
\subsection{Energy input to the case}  from the actuator is
    \[
    E_{ca} = \sum_t  f(t)\Delta x_2
    \]


%%%%** Section 2.4
\subsection{Output to Skin} will be interpreted as  work done on
    (deformation of) the skin stiffness ($K_2$) as
    \[
    E_{sk} = K_2(x_2-x_3)\dot{x}_2 \Delta t
    \]

%%%%** Section 2.5
\subsection{Energy Dissipation in Skin ($B_3$)}
    Since only one end of the skin damper is moving, we have a simpler form than the LRA damper:
    \[
    E_{B3} = B_3\dot{x}_3^2\Delta t
    \]


%%%%** Section 3 
\section{Q3: How well is energy conserved in the numerical simulation computations?}

In the steady state, over one or more complete cycles of the drive frequency,
the energy input to the system must be equal to the energy dissipated in the two
dampers since masses and springs can only store and release energy.  However, numerical bookeeping
errors (``energy leaks'') can arise if numerical precision is not sufficient.  Thus we
numerically compared
\[
E_{leak} = E_{so} - E_{B_1} - E_{B_3}
\]
for a period of time after the system reaches steady state vibration. Ideally $E_{leak}=0$, but we will
strive to keep it such that
%%%%** Equation 1 
\begin{equation}\label{EqnEnergyBalance}
|E_{leak}| < 0.01 E_{so}
\end{equation}


%%%%** Section 4 
\section{Q4: What are suitable experiments for answering the above questions?}

Computational experiments with this model fall into two classes 1) model validation and 2)
hypothesis testing.

Model validation will consist of verification of Eqn \ref{EqnEnergyBalance}.

Two questions amount to hypothesis testing:
%%%%** Section 4.1
\subsection{}\label{ResQ1}
\begin{quotation}  All other parameters being equal, is a system that is resonant ($0<\zeta<1.0$) more ``efficient''
compared to a system that is non-resonant ($\zeta=1.0$)?
\end{quotation}

And, a related question is:
%%%%** Section 4.2
\subsection{}\label{ResQ2}
\begin{quotation}
If resonant systems  $S_1$ and $S_2$ have damping ratios $\zeta_1$ and $\zeta_2$ respectively, if
$0<\zeta_1 < \zeta_2<1$, is $S_1$ more efficient?
\end{quotation}

A simpler question which is not the same as efficiency, is,
%%%%** Section 4.3
\subsection{}\label{ResQ3}
\begin{quotation} Given a fixed force input signal,
does a resonant  ($0<\zeta<1.0$)  system have a greater output (displacement or energy)?
\end{quotation}


\paragraph{Efficiency}
With full consideration of Question Q\ref{WhatAreEnergyFlows}, it becomes
clear that conservation of energy requires that all energy dissipated in the
dampers $(B_1, B_3)$ to be supplied by the energy source under all steady state conditions
and regardless of $\zeta, \omega$, etc..
Transiently, as energy enters or leaves the combined mass-spring system, damper dissipation
will not be equal to source energy.

Furthermore,
greater motion of the masses drives greater energy dissipation in the dampers.

Assuming we define efficiency as
\[
ee = \frac {E_{sk}}  {E_{so}} = \frac {\mathrm{E~to ~skin} } { \mathrm {E~from~source} }
\]
there is
no free lunch, and if resonant systems have a higher output energy it must be
in direct proportion to increased energy drawn from their power source.

Nevertheless, if ``efficiency'' may have other definitions such as

\[
eo = \frac {O_{sk}}  {F_{so}} = \frac {\mathrm{Output~to ~skin} } { \mathrm {Force~from~source} }
\]
where output is, for example RMS skin surface deformation or velocity or
we consider a force or displacement variable instead of energy.

We define the following computational experiment to simulate various
inputs and compute the above efficiencies, $ee, eo$.:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define our parameters and constants of the system. We specify the resonant
    frequency of the LRA components to be 150Hz, use the measured value of
    $M_1$, and derive $K_1$ accordingly.

    \item While $\omega_n = 150\times2\pi\;rad/sec$ of the physical system
    is held constant, we define a range of test
    frequencies at which to drive the system:
        \[
            0.95 \omega_n < \omega < 1.05 \omega_n
            \]
        having $npar$ discrete values, as well as a range of $npar$ system damping ratios:
            \[
                0.01 < \zeta < 1.0
                \]
    We set $npar=10$.

    \item For each pair $\omega_i, \zeta_i$, we simulate the system for
    \[
    400 \mathrm{cycles}\times 150 Hz = 2.67 \mathrm(sec)
    \]
    and compute the various  amplitudes and energy flows.
    To avoid transient effects, we compute the energy flows over only the final
    25\% (100cycles)
    of the simulation time.

    \item Plot the result as a heatmap.

\end{enumerate}



%%%%** Section 5 
\section{Computational Results}

We first address the issue of energy bookkeeping.  Using the above workflow, we
 computed $E_{leak}$ expressed as a percentage of the actuator output energy,
$eso$ (Figure \ref{EleakFig}).   We see that energy leakage is below 1.2\%
for all combinations, with the larger errors evident for less resonant
systems ($\zeta \to 1.0$).


%%%%** Figure 2 
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{heatmapleakage_11x11.png}
\caption{}\label{EleakFig}
\end{figure}


Energy delivered to the skin (Figure \ref{SkinEFig}) has its highest value at the resonant
frequency ($\omega=\omega_n$) and with the lowest value of
$\zeta$ as expected, but also interestingly shows higher outputs
just below the $\omega_n$ than just above it.  Typically this is expected
due to the damped natural frequency, $\omega_d$ being equal to $\zeta\omega_n$ ($\zeta<1$).

\end{figure}

Actuator energy output  (Figure \ref{EoutFig}) shows a similar pattern to skin energy,
sharply peaking at the resonant frequency.

{\bf RE-WRITE in view of latest plots: }
Now we address efficiency: $ee$ in terms of energy to skin vs. actuator output energy
(Figure \ref{EEficFig}).

{\bf RE-WRITE in view of latest plots: }
Next we look at ``Gain'', the ratio of skin displacement magnitude to LRA mass displacement
(Figure \ref{GainFig}).  {\bf As of now,} this is a very anomalous result in which the
gain gets lower as damping gets lower.
